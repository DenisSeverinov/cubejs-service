## Cube.js service example

Before you begin the process of creating your project, it is essential to familiarize yourself with the [official Cube.js documentation](https://cube.dev/docs/getting-started/core/create-a-project). This guide will provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to create a `Docker` file, launch the container, and generate the required schema using a test database.

This repository contains an example `Cube.js` project structure, generated after running the `Cube.js` service with `Docker` and creating the Users schema.

For a basic example of a client application that makes use of this Cube.js service, refer to the instructions in the
[devextreme-cubejs-datagrid-reports](https://github.com/DenisSeverinov/devextreme-cubejs-datagrid-reports) repository. This repository showcases the process of building a reporting application with `DevExtreme DataGrid` and `Cube.js`.
